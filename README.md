# JavaScript source code for Ancient Empires 1 and 2 (Android versions)

## Ancient Empires 1

The JS source codes are stored in the "**AE1**" directory. They are separated into the tree structure by the original developer, so you can read them directly to understand the internal logics of the game.

## Ancient Empires 2

The JS source codes are stored in the **AE2** directory. They are compressed into one single file called **all.min.js**. Hence you have to convert it to a pretty, readable format. You may read the **[pretty-js.md](https://github.com/ancient-empires-resources/js-Android/blob/main/pretty-js.md)** file to find out how to do this. The converted source code is stored in the **[pretty.js](https://github.com/ancient-empires-resources/js-Android/blob/main/AE2/pretty.js)** file.

For your convenience, a Makefile is included in the **AE2** directory. Simply type `make` to have everything done automatically for you. Or you can use it to customize the option flags when generating the pretty JS file.
