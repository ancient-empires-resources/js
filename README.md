# JavaScript source code for Ancient Empires 1 and 2 (Android versions)

## Ancient Empires 1

The JS source codes are stored in the "**AE1**" directory. They are separated into the tree structure by the original developer, so you can read them directly to understand the internal logics of the game.

## Ancient Empires 2

The JS source codes are stored in the **AE2** directory. They are compressed into one single file called **all.min.js**. Hence you have to check out the **pretty-js.md** file to see how to convert the file into pretty format. The converted source code is stored in the **pretty.js** file.
