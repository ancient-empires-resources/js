This directory contains the source code for **Ancient Empires 2 (Android version)**.

* `all.js`: Extracted from the old version **1.6.5**. This is the last version before the original author started compressing the code into `all.min.js` in 1.8.0. Hence, it is worthy for studying how the game actually works.
* `all.min.js`: Extracted from the newest version **1.9.5**. The author has no longer updated it since November 2015.
* `beautified.js`: This is the prettified code generated from `all.min.js`. You can simply type `make` to automatically generate this file. Make sure that you have the NPM module **[js-beautify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-beautify)** installed. Check the **[js-beautify.md](https://github.com/ancient-empires-resources/js-Android/blob/main/js-beautify.md)** file in the upper directory to find out how to do this.
